# **G7RobloxLauncher**
## Discription:
### A python script to map possible location of RobloxPlayerBeta.exe then execute it.

# **Problem**
### Each time Roblox has an update, it makes a new directory. It will make the other versions directory empty and links going to the old versions directories will be broken and unusable.

# **Solution**
### Maps Program Files, Program Files(x86) and LocalAppData directories to locate the current working version of RobloxPlayerBeta.exe.

# **STAY TUNED FOR THE PACKAGE INSTALLER RELEASE...**
